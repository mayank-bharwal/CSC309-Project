I used AI to assist with:
- Implementing error handling and input validation for API endpoints
- Creating in-memory rate-limiting logic for password reset requests
- Debugging and fixing routes that failed automated tests, including:
  - Fixing promotion type detection and one-time usage tracking
  - Correcting route ordering (e.g., /users/me before /users/:userId)
  - Adding strict field validation to reject unexpected fields
  - Handling null vs undefined values in request bodies
  - Implementing proper date validation
  - Fixing JWT authentication and authorization flows
- Creating debug logging middleware for troubleshooting (later removed)
- Writing ai.txt
